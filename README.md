# A chronology of deep learning

Hey everyone who is reading this! 

So what is the hook with deep learning? Why is everyone talking about it? What happened? Well, in the last three decades, a lot of awesome ideas came out, leading to exceptional breakthroughs on general benchmark tasks to evaluate AI systems performance, like image classification, voice recognition, etc. To get the bigger picture, this repository tries to list in chronological order the main papers about deep learning. The number of citations is given according to Google Scholar stats. 

## Before the 1980s

* The concepton of *perceptron* traces back to 1957-58:\
[The perceptron: a probabilistic model for information storage and organization in the brain](http://www2.fiit.stuba.sk/~cernans/nn/nn_texts/neuronove_siete_priesvitky_02_Q.pdf), Rosenblatt, 1958, Psychological Review, **7784 citations**

## 1980s

* Recurrent connections were invented at the beginning of the 1980s:\
[Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities](http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/79/8/2554.full.pdf), Hopfield, 1982, NAS, **19632 citations (!)**

* Deep learning would exist as it exists now if it was not for Geoffrey Hinton, David Rumelhart and Ronald Williams invention of the Backpropagation algorithm: \
[Learning representations by back-propagating erros](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/naturebp.pdf), Rumelhart et al., 1986, Nature, **14500 citations** (!)\
From this point, it was possible to train arbitrarily deep feed-forward neural networks. 

* A few years after, training deep recurrent nets was detailed in this paper: \
[A learning algorithm for continually running fully recurrent neural networks](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.52.9724&rep=rep1&type=pdf), Williams et al., 1989, Neural Computation, **2913 citations**

## 1990s

Despite promising breakthroughs in the late 1980s, in the 1990s, AI entered a new *Winter era*, during the which there were few developments (especially compared to what happened in the 2010s). Deep learning approaches were discredited because of their average performance, mostly because of lack of training data and computational power.

* The wake-sleep algorithm inspired the autoencoder type of neural networks: \
[The wake-sleep algorithm for unsupervised neural networks](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/ws.pdf), Hinton et al., 1995, Science, **942 citations**

* Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed in the early 1990s, mostly by Yann LeCun, and their broad application was described here: \
[Convolutional neural networks for images, speech and time-series](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yann_Lecun/publication/2453996_Convolutional_Networks_for_Images_Speech_and_Time-Series/links/0deec519dfa2325502000000.pdf), Yann LeCun & Yoshua Bengio, 1995, The Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks, **1550 citations**

* LSTMs, still widely used today for sequence modeling, are actually quite an old invention: \
[Long short-term memory](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~itamar/courses/ECE-692/Bobby_paper1.pdf), Hochreiter et al., 1997, Neural Computation, **9811 citations**

* Roughly around the same time as LSTMs came the idea of training RNNs in *both directions*, meaning that hiddent states have access to input elements from the future: \
[Bidirectional recurrent neural networks](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mike_Schuster/publication/3316656_Bidirectional_recurrent_neural_networks/links/56861d4008ae19758395f85c.pdf), Schuster et al., 1997, IEEE Transactions on Neural Processing, **1167 citations**

* At the end of the 1990s, Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, regarded today as two of the godfathers in deep learning, generalized document recognition via neural networks trained by gradient desent, and introduced Graph Transformer Networks : \
[Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition](http://www.dengfanxin.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1998Lecun.pdf), LeCun et al., 1998, IEEE, **12546 citations (!)**
