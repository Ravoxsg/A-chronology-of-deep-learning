# A chronology of deep learning

Hey everyone who is reading this! 

So what is the hook with deep learning? Why is everyone talking about it? What happened? Well, in the last three decades, a lot of awesome ideas came out, leading to exceptional breakthroughs on general benchmark tasks to evaluate AI systems performance, like image classification, voice recognition, etc. To get the bigger picture, this repo tries to list in chrnological order the main papers about deep learning.
